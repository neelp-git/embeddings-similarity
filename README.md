# embeddings-similarity
Experiment with accuracy of similarity searches on a dataset with known similar and dissimilar content. View the post in similarity_exp.md (or [Medium](https://medium.com/misc-posts/an-experiment-with-similarity-search-and-embeddings-6b015a8826fe)) and the Jupyter notebook similarity.ipynb. 

Part 2 in similarity2.ipynb uses a vector database (Pinecone) to store embeddings ("all-MiniLM-L6-v2" and "text-embedding-ada-002") and perform similarity searches using different metrics.
